> Watson Conversation is now Watson Assistant. Although some images in this code pattern may show the service as Watson Conversation, the steps and processes will still work.

# Create a banking chatbot with FAQ discovery, anger detection and natural language understanding
In this developer journey, we will create a chatbot using Node.js and Watson Assistant. The Assistant flow will be enhanced by using Natural Language Understanding to identify entities and using Tone Analyzer to detect customer emotions. For FAQs, a call to the Discovery service will use passage retrieval to pull answers from a collection of documents.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Create a chatbot that converses via a web UI using Watson Assistant and Node.js
* Use Watson Discovery with passage retrieval to find answers in FAQ documents
* Use Watson Tone Analyzer to detect emotion in a conversation
* Identify entities with Watson Natural Language Understanding

## Flow
1. The FAQ documents are added to the Discovery collection.
2. The user interacts with a chatbot via the app UI.
3. User input is processed with Tone Analyzer to detect anger. An anger score is added to the context.
4. User input is processed with Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The context is enriched with NLU-detected entities and keywords (e.g., a location).
5. The input and enriched context is sent to Assistant. Assistant recognizes intent, entities and dialog paths. It responds with a reply and/or action.
6. Optionally, a requested action is performed by the app. This may include one of the following:
   * Lookup additional information from bank services to append to the reply
   * Use Discovery to reply with an answer from the FAQ documents

# Steps

Use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

## Deploy to IBM Cloud
[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot.git)

1. Press the above ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.

2. In Toolchains, click on ``Delivery Pipeline`` to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking ``View app.
![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

3. To see the app and services created and configured for this journey, use the Bluemix dashboard. The app is named `watson-banking-chatbot` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wbc-` prefix:
    * wbc-conversation-service
    * wbc-discovery-service
    * wbc-natural-language-understanding-service
    * wbc-tone-analyzer-service

## Run locally
> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button.

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Watson services with IBM Cloud](#2-create-watson-services-with-ibm-cloud)
3. [Import the Watson Assistant workspace](#3-import-the-watson-assistant-workspace)
4. [Load the Discovery documents](#4-load-the-discovery-documents)
5. [Configure credentials](#5-configure-credentials)
5. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-banking-chatbot` locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot
```

We’ll be using the file [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and the folder
[`data/conversation/workspaces/`](data/conversation/workspaces/)

### 2. Create Watson services with IBM Cloud

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Assistant**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)
* [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)
* [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)
* [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

### 3. Import the Watson Assistant workspace

Launch the **Watson Assistant** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="55" src="doc/source/images/import_conversation_workspace.png">
</p>

Find the local version of [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**. Save this ID for later.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="doc/source/images/WCSViewdetails.png">
</p>

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.png)

### 4. Load the Discovery documents

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection**
and give the data collection a unique name.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="doc/source/images/new_collection.png">
</p>

> Save the **environment_id** and **collection_id** for your `.env` file in the next step.

Under `Add data to this collection` use `Drag and drop your documents here or browse from computer` to seed the content with the five documents in `data/discovery/docs`.

### 5. Configure credentials

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (Assistant, Discovery, Tone Analyzer and
Natural Language Understanding), can be found in the ``Services`` menu in IBM Cloud,
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for each service.

The other settings for Assistant and Discovery were collected during the
earlier setup steps (``DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID``, ``DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`` and
``WORKSPACE_ID``).

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Copy this file to .env and replace the credentials with 
# your own before starting the app.

# TONE_ANALYZER_IAM_APIKEY=<add_tone_analyzer_iam_apikey>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000
```

### 6. Run the application
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Use the chatbot at `localhost:3000`.

# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used `Deploy to IBM Cloud` the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environment is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have
a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old
service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell
the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment
using the default configuration.

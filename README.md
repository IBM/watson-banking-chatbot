# Create a banking chatbot with FAQ discovery, anger detection and natural language understanding
In this developer journey, we will create a chatbot using Node.js and Watson Conversation. The Conversation flow will be enhanced by using Natural Language Understanding to identify entities and using Tone Analyzer to detect customer emotions. For FAQs, a call to the Discovery service will use passage retrieval to pull answers from a collection of documents.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Create a chatbot that converses via a web UI using Watson Conversation and Node.js
* Use Watson Discovery with passage retrieval to find answers in FAQ documents
* Use Watson Tone Analyzer to detect emotion in a conversation
* Identify entities with Watson Natural Language Understanding

![](doc/source/images/architecture.png)

## Flow
1. The FAQ documents are added to the Discovery collection.
2. The user interacts with a chatbot via the app UI.
3. User input is processed with Tone Analyzer to detect anger. An anger score is added to the context.
4. User input is processed with Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The context is enriched with NLU-detected entities and keywords (e.g., a location).
5. The input and enriched context is sent to Conversation. Conversation recognizes intent, entities and dialog paths. It responds with a reply and/or action.
6. Optionally, a requested action is performed by the app. This may include one of the following:
   * Lookup additional information from bank services to append to the reply
   * Use Discovery to reply with an answer from the FAQ documents

# Steps

Use the ``Deploy to Bluemix`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

## Deploy to Cloud Foundry on Bluemix
[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://deployment-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/3999122db8b59f04eecad8d229814d83/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot.git)

1. Press the above ``Deploy to Bluemix`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.

2. In Toolchains, click on Delivery Pipeline to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking 'View app'.
![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

3. To see the app and services created and configured for this journey, use the Bluemix dashboard. The app is named `watson-banking-chatbot` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wbc-` prefix:
    * wbc-conversation-service
    * wbc-discovery-service
    * wbc-natural-language-understanding-service
    * wbc-tone-analyzer-service

## Deploy to Kubernetes on Bluemix

The following steps outline the process for deploying this application as-is to Kubernetes on IBM Bluemix.  You can read more about [Kubernetes Support and the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI on the Bluemix blog](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/09/deploying-kubernetes-ibm-cloud-ibm-cloud-developer-tools-cli/).

1. [Create a Kubernetes cluster on Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/containers-kubernetes/launch?) if you do not already have one. 

   *Note: This may take up to 15 minutes for a cluster to be provisioned.*

2. Install the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/ibm-cloud-developer-tools/)

    If you're on a MacOS or Linux machine, open up a terminal and execute the following command:

    ```
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```

    If you're on a windows machine, open Windows PowerShell by right-clicking and select "Run as Administrator":

    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ibm.biz/idt-win-installer')
    ``` 

    This will install the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI, the Bluemix CLI, Docker, the Kubernetes CLI, and all other dependencies if they are not already installed.

3. [Create a namespace in the IBM Container Registry](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Registry/index.html#registry_namespace_add), if you do not already have one.

    * Open a terminal or command prompt.
    * Log into the Bluemix CLI:
        ```
        bx login
        ```
    * Create a namespace using the `bx cr` command:

        ```
        bx cr namespace-add <my_namespace>
        ```
        
      This will add a namespace to create your own image repository. Replace `<my_namespace>` with your preferred namespace.

4. Follow all 6 steps in the instructions below to [run locally](#run-locally).

5. Open a terminal and cd into the folder containing the project downloaded in the `run locally` steps.   Within a terminal use the `bx dev enable` command and answer all questions to generate Kubernetes deployment assets.

    ```
    cd watson-banking-chatbot/
    bx dev enable
    ```

    You can learn more about the `bx dev enable` process on the [Bluemix blog](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/09/enable-existing-projects-ibm-cloud-ibm-cloud-developer-tools-cli/). 

6. Open the generated `cli-config.yml` file and append entries at the end of the file to instruct the `bx dev deploy` command to target the Kubernetes environment:

    ```
    deploy-target: "container"
    ibm-cluster: "<my_cluster>"
    deploy-image-target: "registry.ng.bluemix.net/<my_namespace>/watson-banking-chatbot"
    ```     

    The `deploy-target` value instructs the CLI to target Kubernetes deployment.  
    
    The `ibm-cluster` value will contain the name of your Kubernetes cluster on IBM Bluemix.  Replace `<my_cluster>` with the name of your cluster.

    The `deploy-image-target` value will point to the Docker container registry where the CLI will push the application's compiled Docker image.  Replace `<my_namespace>` with the namespace that you created in the Bluemix Container Registry.

7. Invoke the `deploy` command to start the Kubernetes deployment.

    ```
    bx dev deploy
    ```

    The `deploy` command will compile the application's Docker image, push that image to the IBM Bluemix Container Registry, and then perform a Kubernetes deployment using the Helm chart (Kubernetes deployment template) that was generated as part of the `bx dev enable` process.    

    You can use the Kubernetes CLI's `kubectl proxy` command to view the status of the Kubernetes deployment.

8. Once your deployment is complete, the application will be running on your Kubernetes cluster's public node and exposed service port.   Use the following command to see this configuration:

    ```
    kubectl get nodes,services
    ```

    A sample output from this command is:

    ```
    NAME                STATUS    AGE       VERSION
    no/173.193.100.91   Ready     53d       v1.5.6-4+abe34653415733

    NAME                       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    svc/kubernetes             10.10.10.1     <none>        443/TCP          53d
    svc/watsonbankingchatbot   10.10.10.187   <nodes>       3000:31310/TCP   1h
    ```
    
    In this case, the node's public IP address is `173.193.100.91` and the "watsonbankingchatbot" service's public port is `31310`, so the application will be available at http://173.193.100.91:31310. Note: These ports can be configured in paid Kubernetes clusters, but not in the free tier.


## Run locally
> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the ``Deploy to Bluemix`` button.

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Watson services with IBM Bluemix](#2-create-watson-services-with-ibm-bluemix)
3. [Import the Conversation workspace](#3-import-the-conversation-workspace)
4. [Load the Discovery documents](#4-load-the-discovery-documents)
5. [Configure credentials](#5-configure-credentials)
5. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-banking-chatbot` locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot
```

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and the folder
[`data/conversation/workspaces/`](data/conversation/workspaces/)

### 2. Create Watson services with IBM Bluemix

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)
* [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)
* [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)
* [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

### 3. Import the Conversation workspace

Launch the **Watson Conversation** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="55" src="doc/source/images/import_conversation_workspace.png">
</p>

Find the local version of [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**. Save this ID for later.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="doc/source/images/WCSViewdetails.png">
</p>

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.png)

### 4. Load the Discovery documents

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection**
and give the data collection a unique name.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="doc/source/images/new_collection.png">
</p>

> Save the **environment_id** and **collection_id** for your `.env` file in the next step.

Under `Add data to this collection` use `Drag and drop your documents here or browse from computer` to seed the content with the five documents in `data/discovery/docs`.

### 5. Configure credentials

The credentials for Bluemix services (Conversation, Discovery, Tone Analyzer and
Natural Language Understanding), can be found in the ``Services`` menu in Bluemix,
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for each service.

The other settings for Conversation and Discovery were collected during the
earlier setup steps (``DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID``, ``DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`` and
``WORKSPACE_ID``).

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Replace the credentials here with your own.
# Rename this file to .env before starting the app.

# Watson conversation
CONVERSATION_USERNAME=<add_conversation_username>
CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=<add_conversation_password>
WORKSPACE_ID=<add_conversation_workspace>

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_USERNAME=<add_discovery_username>
DISCOVERY_PASSWORD=<add_discovery_password>
DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=<add_discovery_environment>
DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID=<add_discovery_collection>

# Watson Natural Language Understanding
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_USERNAME=<add_nlu_username>
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_PASSWORD=<add_nlu_password>

# Watson Tone Analyzer
TONE_ANALYZER_USERNAME=<add_tone_analyzer_username>
TONE_ANALYZER_PASSWORD=<add_tone_analyzer_password>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000

```

### 6. Run the application
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Use the chatbot at `localhost:3000`.
> Note: server host can be changed as required in server.js and `PORT` can be set in `.env`.

# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used `Deploy to Bluemix` the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environent is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have
a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old
service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell
the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment
using the default configuration.
